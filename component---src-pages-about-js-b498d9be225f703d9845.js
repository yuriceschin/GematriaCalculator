L. Gillis in 1996, and published on his website since 1998. Known as Trigrammaton Qabalah, or TQ, this system is based on one of the Holy Books of Thelema written by Aleister Crowley in 1907, called Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang. Liber Trigrammaton (aka Liber XXVII) was called by Crowley \"the ultimate foundation of the highest theoretical qabalah\". In Liber XXVII are 27 three-line diagrams known as 'trigrams', which are composed of a solid line representing the Yang, a broken line representing the Yin, and a point representing the Tao. Crowley later attributed the 26 letters of the English alphabet to these trigrams, in an attempt to fulfill an injunction found in his earlier work The Book of the Law, or Liber AL vel Legis.",r.a.createElement("br",null),r.a.createElement("br",null),'In Liber AL, verse 2:55 states: "Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto". By attributing the English alphabet to the trigrams of his later work, Crowley considered this verse to be fulfilled, as noted in his "Old Comment" to The Book of the Law. The TQ is an extension of Crowley\'s work with Liber Trigrammaton. By considering the numerical value of the 27 trigrams as expressions in Base 3, (or ternary), and then transferring those values to the letters attributed by Crowley to the trigrams, a system of English gematria is created. Further use is made of the trigrams to create a true qabalah in the sense of the definition provided by Jake Stratton-Kent above. In the TQ, correspondences are created with all the major forms of divination such as I Ching, tarot and runes, as well as Greek and Hebrew alphabets, the qabalistic Tree of Life, Western and Vedic astrology, magic squares, and the Platonic solids of geometry. A primary feature of this qabalah is a new understanding of the Cube of Space and its 26 components of edges, faces and vertices, which equal the number of Roman script letters used in the English alphabet.'),r.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Qabalah#Trigrammaton_Qabalah_(TQ)"},r.a.createElement("blockquote",{cite:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Qabalah#Trigrammaton_Qabalah_(TQ)"},"Wikipedia")))}},Bl7J:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("q1tI"),r=a.n(n),i=a("Wbzz"),l=(a("8ypT"),function(e){return r.a.createElement("li",null,r.a.createElement(i.Link,{to:e.to},e.children))});t.a=function(e){var t=e.children;return r.a.createElement("div",null,r.a.createElement("header",null,r.a.createElement(i.Link,{to:"/",id:"title"},r.a.createElement("h1",null,"TQ Gematria Calculator")),r.a.createElement("ul",null,r.a.createElement(l,{to:"/"},"Home"),r.a.createElement(l,{to:"/about/"},"About"),r.a.createElement(l,{to:"/words-analysis/"},"Words Analysis"))),t,r.a.createElement("footer",null,r.a.createElement("p",null,"Copyright 2020 Â© O.T.O.
